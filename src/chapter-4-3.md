Experimentation is another important component of a learning orientation. By experimenting, individuals can test new ideas, learn from failures, and make informed decisions based on data. Here are some practical techniques for experimentation:

* **Start small:** Start with small experiments to test hypotheses and gather data.

* **Measure results:** Use metrics to evaluate performance and measure the impact of experiments.

* **Embrace failure:** Reframe failure as an opportunity to learn and inform future experimentation.
